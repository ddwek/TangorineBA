	0.3.1 Release
	* Fixed validate_row_constraints () and validate_col_constraints ()
	* get_path2() removed, due it's no longer needed (it is implemented
	  on BTree-dd.tcc as "get_path()"
	* Fixed clear_game_cb() from a bogus behavior in which an immutable
	  cell was displayed with hatchings on the same row and same column
	  than the current clicked
	* New global variable "setlist" just for sharing states declared on
	  src/Callback.cc. The older approach based on a static variable
	  within "button_press_cb()" was replaced for was described above

	0.3.0 Release
	* New features like adding a red led timer on the top-right of the

	  (i.e., "reset") the current game to its standard solution values

	0.2.0 Release
	* We added testing and then we realize how much underrated QA Manual
	  Testing is and now we know that QA Automation is really needed in
	  order to enhance the app quality on CI/CD feedbacks and Agile
	  Methodologies. There's a lot of explainations and details on files
	  under "./src" (e.g., Board.cc and Callback.cc) and "./test"
	  subdirectories.

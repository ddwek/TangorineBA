	0.3.0 Release
	* New features like adding a red led timer on the top-right of the
	  window, a button to start a new game and another button to clear
	  (i.e., "reset") the current game to its standard solution values

	0.2.1 Release
	* Fixed a typo after an opening bracket which does not let you
	  compile the game (unless you fix it before)

	0.2.0 Release
	* We added testing and then we realize how much underrated QA Manual
	  Testing is and now we know that QA Automation is really needed in
	  order to enhance the app quality on CI/CD feedbacks and Agile
	  Methodologies. There's a lot of explainations and details on files
	  under "./src" (e.g., Board.cc and Callback.cc) and "./test"
	  subdirectories.

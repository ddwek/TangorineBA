	0.2.0 Release
	* We added testing and then we realize how much underrated QA Manual
	  Testing is and now we know that QA Automation is really needed in
	  order to enhance the app quality on CI/CD feedbacks and Agile
	  Methodologies. There's a lot of explainations and details on files
	  under "./src" (e.g., Board.cc and Callback.cc) and "./test"
	  subdirectories.

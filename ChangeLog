	0.4.0 Release
	* Added undo/redo history at src/Callback.cc. They're like wrappers
	  for the "stack" C++ template, but specialized for handling our
	  stacks, including the complete downwards data clearing whether
	  the top of the history is in the middle of the stack.
	* Fixed setlist.insert() at src/Callback.cc (button_press_cb ()).
	* Added a cairo animation to celebrate when you win. It's not a
	  GIF, just cairo API.
	* Added .desktop file and all-size icons to copy to your system
	  when installing the game.
	* Now you can see how you should see the final installation of the
	  game by comparing it to the new screenshot, which is located at
	  the top-level of the source (the same dir as ChangeLog lives in).

	0.3.2 Release
	* Updated many Board methods to support scalable graphics via cairo
	  API, not SVG images. It includes X/Y factors which are used to
	  multiply the original sizes of all the elements into the main
	  window to those ones taking new values when the window is resized
	* New CallbackData methods, start_timer() and stop_timer(). As you
	  can realize, the start_timer() is called each time a new game is
	  run and, on the other hand, stop_timer() is called previously to
	  show congratulations for having won the current game

	0.3.1 Release
	* Fixed validate_row_constraints () and validate_col_constraints ()
	* get_path2() removed, due it's no longer needed (it is implemented
	  on BTree-dd.tcc as "get_path()"
	* Fixed clear_game_cb() from a bogus behavior in which an immutable
	  cell was displayed with hatchings on the same row and same column
	  than the current clicked
	* New global variable "setlist" just for sharing states declared on
	  src/Callback.cc. The older approach based on a static variable
	  within "button_press_cb()" was replaced for was described above

	0.3.0 Release
	* New features like adding a red led timer on the top-right of the
	  window, a button to start a new game and another button to clear
	  (i.e., "reset") the current game to its standard solution values

	0.2.1 Release
	* Fixed a typo after an opening bracket which does not let you
	  compile the game (unless you fix it before)

	0.2.0 Release
	* We added testing and then we realize how much underrated QA Manual
	  Testing is and now we know that QA Automation is really needed in
	  order to enhance the app quality on CI/CD feedbacks and Agile
	  Methodologies. There's a lot of explainations and details on files
	  under "./src" (e.g., Board.cc and Callback.cc) and "./test"
	  subdirectories.

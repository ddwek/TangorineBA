TangorineBA
===========

TangorineBA is a clone from the classic LNKN Tango web app that you can play
every day at 09:00 a.m., according to your timezone.

Like such a game, the goal is place one coin at a time at the right place of
the board, so that when you have located 18 suns and 18 moons in the correct
order you win!

Rules are really simple:

1. Each row-column intersection (hereinafter, "cells") must be set to one
   sun or one moon.

2. As the board is a 6x6 matrix, you'll need to put three shapes for each
   row and column.

3. There must be no more of two identical shapes located adjacently. That is:

   S M		ok
   S S          ok
   S S S	wrong disposition

4. There are immutable cells, which contains one constant shape and cannot
   be changed (BTW, "immutable" is a word that I borrowed from Python's
   terminology, I think it's straightforward to understand for everyone).

5. Each new board has some cells with restrictions on what is the kind of
   shape you can place together. They are called "constraints" and, as
   you may realized, they indicate whether the top, right, down or left cell
   can store identical or different shapes. Cells with an '=' allow identical
   shapes and cells with an 'x' do not.

These are the first releases, there is so much work to do, but in the meantime
you can play these versions which were tested on many systems.

Hope you enjoy!!!
